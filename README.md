## May be the force with youâš¡

Welcome to my profile!
I am a 4th year student, software engineer, computer science teacher at a lyceum at the moment and a qa manual in the past. 
I had a huge experience in writing test cases, checklists, and test documentation, particulary in manual game testing. 
More than 2 years of work as a QA manual, and more than 1 year as a QA lead at CRISTALIX.GG.
